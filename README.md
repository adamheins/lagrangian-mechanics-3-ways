# Lagrangian Mechanics Three Ways

This is source code for a my [blog post]() on implementing a robot's dynamic
equations of motion three ways:
1. with manual differentiation,
2. with automatic differentiation,
3. with symbolic differentiation.

The Jupyter notebook containing the code can be run in the browser [here]().
Alternatively, you can download the repo and open the notebook yourself.
